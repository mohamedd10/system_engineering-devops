In shell scripting, it’s often necessary to check the properties of files or directories before performing operations on them. This ensures your scripts behave correctly and avoid errors. Bash provides various file test operators that allow you to check for existence, type, permissions, and size.

The objective of this task is to ensure you can use conditional statements (if and else) to test different properties of a file and print specific messages based on those tests.

Task: Write a Bash script that provides information about a file named school. Your script should perform the following checks and print the corresponding messages:

Check for existence:
* If the `school` file exists, print: `school file exists`
* If the `school` file does not exist, print: `school file does not exist`
If the file exists, then perform further checks:
* If the `school` file is empty, print: `school file is empty`
* If the `school` file is not empty, print: `school file is not empty`
* If the `school` file is a regular file (not a directory, symbolic link, etc.), print: `school is a regular file`
* If the `school` file is not a regular file (e.g., it's a directory), do not print anything for this specific check.
Requirements:

You must use if and else statements.
The case statement is forbidden for this task.
Here is an example illustrating how your script should behave when executed with different states of the school file:

sylvain@ubuntu$ file school
school: cannot open `school' (No such file or directory)
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./9-to_file_or_not_to_file 
school file does not exist
sylvain@ubuntu$ touch school
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./9-to_file_or_not_to_file 
school file exists
school file is empty
school is a regular file
sylvain@ubuntu$ echo 'betty' > school 
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./9-to_file_or_not_to_file 
school file exists
school file is not empty
school is a regular file
sylvain@ubuntu$ rm school 
sylvain@ubuntu$ mkdir school
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./9-to_file_or_not_to_file 
school file exists
school file is not empty
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
Take note!

The first line of your Bash script should be #!/usr/bin/env bash.
The second line should be a comment explaining what it’s doing.
